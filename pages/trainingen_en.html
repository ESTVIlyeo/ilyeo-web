<h2>Training program</h2>
<p>
	All sorts of exercises are embedded in the trainings, taking place two times a week led by our first dan black belt trainer. A training is more or less constructed as follows:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Warming up</b>: Running, jumping, power or balance-exercises combined with practising reflexes.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Flexibility</b>; you will be amazed by your own flexibility as a result of the extensive stretching routines!
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Kicking techniques</b>: different kicking techniques are trained regularly, rotated with the training of several muscle groups such as legs, arms/chest and stomach/back
	</li>
	<li>
		The remaining content of every training differs: <b>sparring, self-defence, combination kicks, techniques and endurance</b>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Cooling down</b>; often sparring, kicking or punching circuits are concluded with a cooling down. When finished we often hang around in the training hall for some time before meeting up again in sports canteen!
	</li>
</ul>
