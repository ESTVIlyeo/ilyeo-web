<h1>Taekwondo</h1>
<p>
Taekwondo is a Korean martial art predominantly aimed at footwork; you’re right, kicking! There is no better way to conclude a long day of studying than by venting your stress on some pillows and pads. Not to mention its tremendous effects on your coordination and balancing skills. And we haven’t even mentioned the spectacular spinning and flying kicks yet!

Taekwondo at Ilyeo is accessible to every sports-card holder; you are able to train on your own level and pace. Do you prefer to be cautious? Not a problem at all. However still, even the most experienced martial arts practitioners, will be presented the opportunity to fanatically practice the sport. On top of that, <a ui-sref="examens">belt exams</a> and internal competitions are organised for whoever is interested.
