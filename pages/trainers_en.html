<h2>Le Xuan Tung, 2nd Dan holder</h2>
<p>
	I started Taekwondo at Ilyeo from 2011, reached 1st Dan in 2016 and 2nd Dan in 2018.
	I love Taekwondo because of its strong, quick, and efficient movements.
	Tung is in charge of the Monday and Friday trainings at Ilyeo

	Tung mentions: "I started Taekwondo just to get physically stronger, but it also helps me to grow as a person, and I certainly hope it will be the same for you."
