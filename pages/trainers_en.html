<h2>Le Xuan Tung, 2nd Dan</h2>
<p>
	I started Taekwondo at Ilyeo from 2011, reached 1st Dan in 2016 and 2nd Dan in 2018.
	I love Taekwondo because of its strong, quick, and efficient movements.

	Tung is in charge of the Monday and Friday trainings at Ilyeo

<p>
	Tung mentions: "I started Taekwondo just to get physically stronger, but it also helps me to grow as a person, and I certainly hope it will be the same for you."

<h2>Mels van Broekhoven, 1st Dan</h2>
<p>
	When I first started Taekwondo at Ilyeo in 2012 I never imagined I'd be getting very far,
	but through consistent training, perseverance, and dedication I managed to get my black belt in 2018.
	As a trainer I hope to be able to not only teach our members the art of Taekwondo, but also to inspire them to grow beyond their
	own expectations as my trainers did for me.

	Mels is in charge of the Thursday trainings at Ilyeo.
