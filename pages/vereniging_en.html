<h1>Ilyeo</h1>
<p>
	We have been offering the opportunity to train Taekwondo since 2001. In 2004 we founded the Ilyeo sports club. During the past year the amount of members increased to approximately 60. As a result we organise many fun activities on top of the trainings. Paintball, bbqs and skiing trips for example, plus of course plenty spontaneous evenings at members or in pubs.
