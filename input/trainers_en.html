<p>Our trainers are Merijn Donders and Melanie Ahn.</p>
<h2>Merijn Donders</h2>
<p>
	I have been practising martial arts since 1988 when my father placed me at judo (1988-1995). After a lot of training and competitions I decided to continue this passion in taekwondo (1995-present). Since 1998 I am the proud owner of my 1st degree black belt in taekwondo. Through the years I grew into the role of assistant trainer and had been assisting the previous Ilyeo trainer (Redouane) during busy trainings. I regularly taught a class and since January 2011 I am the head trainer at taekwondo Ilyeo. I  teach on Thursdays and (often) the advanced class on Friday.
</p>
<p>
	In addition I have had experience in training various other martial arts, so you will notice influences of, amongst others, Shaolin kung fu, karate, tai chi and kick-boxing.
</p>
<p>
	I hope you have a great time at the training and for questions you can reach me at: merijn at ilyeo.nl

<!--<h2>Andreas Haedler</h2>
<p>
	I started WTF Taekwondo in 1997 joining the club of my hometown Hof (Germany). Owing to the variety of the Taekwondo-training and the great people I met, I got increasingly engulfed in this amazing sport. After practicing Taekwondo for over a decade at different clubs (incl. ITF Taekwondo in Edinburgh) I obtained my first degree black belt (1. Dan) in 2009 and Trainer C and Coach Licences in 2011. Since 2010 I was one of the head coaches at the University of Bayreuth preparing students for belt exams and sparring competitions.

<p>
	I enjoy Taekwondo as an ideal sport for <a href="taekwondo_en.html">fitness and health</a> with a positive effect on endurance, flexibility, physical and mental strength, coordination, balance, as well as self-confidence, self-awareness and even your way of life...
</p>
<p>
	I will take over the Monday training from 8:00 till 9:30 pm and I hope to be able to pass on my passion for Taekwondo also to you.
</p>
<h2>Melanie Ahn</h2>
<p>
	I started practicing taekwondo in 2002, after my parents took my brother to a training of our local club in Maastricht and I wanted to go with them very badly. I thought it was very appealing and never stopped practicing taekwondo since. In 2007 I got my first degree black belt and my second degree black belt in 2009. When I got my 1st Dan, I started teaching to the youngest taekwondokaâ€™s (age 4-14). Currently I take over the trainings at Ilyeo when Merijn and Andreas are not able to give training. At the end of this season, I hope to get my Trainer level 2 license.
</p>
<p>
	I hope you will find as much joy and self-confidence in taekwondo as I did.
