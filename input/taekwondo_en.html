<h1>Taekwondo</h1>
<p>
Taekwondo is a Korean form of martial art, predominately aimed at footwork; you’re right, just kicking! There is no lovelier way to conclude a long day of studying than by giving full vent to some pillows and pads. Not to mention its’ tremendous effects on your coordination and balancing skills. And we haven’t even mentioned the spectacular spinning and flying kicks yet! Paying a quick visit to Youtube in order to watch some awesome demonstrations and fights might just be of interest to you.

<p>
Taekwondo is accessible to everybody; you are able to train on your own level and pace. Do you prefer to be cautious? Not a problem at all. However still, even the most experienced martial arts practitioners, will be presented the opportunity to fanatically practice the sport. On top of that, belt exams and intern competitions are organised for whoever is interested.
