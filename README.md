## Intro
Hi there! Welcome to the source of www.ilyeo.nl. 
If you want to just fix grammatical/language errors in the website or add information, feel free to change any page in
the pages folder or the javascript files in js/data! If you want to stay away from that too, just open an issue right [here](https://github.com/Vaults/ilyeo-web/issues)!

If you want to contribute to the website code, please make sure you are proficient with:
  * [HTML/CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/)
  * [Javascript](http://www.w3schools.com/Js/)
  * [Angular](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_00)
  * [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

You will want to read into this plugin (to just get a base understanding)
  * [angular-ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)
